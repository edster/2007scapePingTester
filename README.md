This tester is created in PowerShell. You will need to be able to execute PowerShell scripts to use it.

You can open the script in PowerShell ISE and execute, or run the file from the PowerShell console.

If you run into execution denied errors run `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` before running the script.
