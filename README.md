# 2007scapePingTester
Test server pings for oldschool runescape

This tester is created in PowerShell. You will need to be able to execute powershell scripts to use it.

You can open the script in PowerShell ISE and just execute.

If you open powershell and execute the script and run into execution denied errors run `set-executionpolicy Unrestricted` in your console before running the script.
